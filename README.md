# SelfBot
## An affordable and Arduino based autonomous rover
---
The objective of this project is to create and program an autonomous rover (like a baby curiosity) 
The Arduino is used as microcontroler for the robot but the challenger was to program it **without the Arduino libraries**
---
## The functionalities
The robot is capable of 
1. Control its movements
2. Detect obstacle using ultrasonic sensordirected by a Servo motor
3. Many other things in the future
